### **Transcript for Meeting 1001 – All Hands with Suchishree**

**Suchishree:**  
"Hi everyone, thank you all for joining today’s all-hands meeting. I’m really happy to see so many of you here. Let’s jump right in. First up, I want to share some quick company updates. Over the past quarter, we’ve seen a 12% increase in client engagement, and our new partnership with Delta Tech is already showing promising results. Kudos to the business development and partnerships teams!"

**Suchishree:**  
"Now, moving on to our 2025 goals. We’re going to double down on three main areas—product innovation, client retention, and operational efficiency. Each department will be receiving revised OKRs by next week, and we’ll be aligning our sprint cycles to reflect these new priorities. We’re also aiming to reduce operational overhead by 15% by the end of Q3. I’ll be working closely with the leadership team to track progress and ensure we’re on target."

**Suchishree:**  
"I also want to take a moment to highlight some outstanding team contributions. The engineering team rolled out the new AI-assisted module two weeks ahead of schedule—brilliant job! And the marketing team? The recent digital campaign brought in 35% more qualified leads than expected. Please give them a big round of applause."

**Suchishree:**  
"Next, a few quick policy updates. We’re introducing a new hybrid work guideline effective next month—Mondays and Thursdays will be in-office collaboration days. You’ll receive a detailed memo about this by EOD today. Additionally, we’re streamlining our reimbursement process through a new app, so submitting claims will be much quicker."

**Suchishree:**  
"Now, I’d like to open the floor for any questions. Feel free to unmute or drop them in the chat."

**Ravi:**  
"Hey Suchishree, quick one from my side—regarding the OKRs you mentioned, will there be a feedback cycle before finalizing them for the teams?"

**Suchishree:**  
"Great question, Ravi. Yes, definitely. Each department lead will host a mini-workshop this week to gather feedback from their team members before finalizing the OKRs. We want this to be collaborative."

**Meera:**  
"Thanks, Suchishree. Also, about the in-office days—will exceptions be made for team members who are working remotely from other cities?"

**Suchishree:**  
"Yes, Meera. Those working remotely due to location constraints won’t be affected by the new hybrid policy. For them, the existing remote arrangement stays unchanged."

**Suchishree:**  
"Alright, if there are no further questions, that’s a wrap! Thanks again everyone for your continued hard work and energy. Let’s make this quarter even better than the last. Have a great rest of your day!"
