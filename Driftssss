Absolutely! You can enhance your existing HTML by adding an else condition to show a positive message when off-topic discussion is 50% or less.

✅ Updated block in statistics.component.html:

<div class="panel drift">
  <h3>DRIFT ANALYSIS</h3>
  <div class="chart-wrapper">
    <canvas baseChart
      [data]="{ labels: drift?.pie?.labels, datasets: drift?.pie?.dataset }"
      [type]="'pie'">
    </canvas>
  </div>

  <div *ngIf="drift">
    <div *ngIf="showDriftMessage; else noDrift" class="drift-warning">
      <p>
        There was a significant drift seen in this meeting as
        {{ offTopicPercentage | number:'1.0-2' }}% of the discussion was off-topic,
        drifting past the agenda.
      </p>
    </div>
    <ng-template #noDrift>
      <div class="drift-success">
        <p>
          The meeting went well, with only
          {{ offTopicPercentage | number:'1.0-2' }}% off-topic discussion. The agenda was mostly followed.
        </p>
      </div>
    </ng-template>
  </div>
</div>

✅ Optional CSS for success message (in statistics.component.css):

.drift-success {
background-color: #e7fbe7;
color: #225d22;
padding: 10px;
margin-top: 10px;
border-radius: 8px;
}

Let me know if you want to customize the messages further based on meeting titles or time durations.
